# Jinzhao's Mind Palance

Welcome to the mind palance of Jinzhao!

Unlike Sherlock Holmes, I cannot save all things into my brain, so a blog/note online could be the best way for me.

As I have said in my GitHub profile, I'm pursuing a full-time job of Data Scientist or Machine Learning Enginner from 2023, and there are still many lacks of knowledge or skills for a well-prepared applicant. That's the reason why I build this learning note, to improve myself towards a best applicant for full-time job.

By the way, being a Quant is still my dream job, and I'm always persisting to learn all necessary skills to be an outstanding Quant.
