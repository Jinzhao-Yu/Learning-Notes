# CYCLICAL STOCHASTIC GRADIENT MCMC FOR BAYESIAN DEEP LEARNING
### Abstract
- cSG-MCMC(Cyclical stochastic gradient MCMC) to explore high-dimensional and multimodal distribution --> NN的weights的后验分布
- cyclical stepsizes: large steps for new modes and small steps for charactering modes, e.g: Multi-Mormal
